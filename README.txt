Together the Web interface and the CSV to XML Converter helps to take ABS data on the tourism business and use that data to recommend areas of the state that are less frequented for holidaymakers.
The web interface also uses the ATDW information to display nearby tourist attractions. This information is displayed on a Map created with Google Maps API v3.

The data taken from the CSV file includes the occupancy rate by month, average stay by month as well as room and bed information. It also hold the number of employees in an area.
